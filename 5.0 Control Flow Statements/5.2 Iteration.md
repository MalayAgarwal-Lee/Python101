## Iteration in Python

### Introduction

Iteration is a basic functionality available in all programming languages. Python is no exception to this. Before I describe the various ways in which you can do iteration, it is important to know what iteration is.


> Iteration is the process of repeating one or more lines of code a certain number of times, so that the lines of code will reevaluate with each repetition.

The above definition is in no way a standard definition, but it gives you the basic idea.

Let's say there is a party at your house. You plan on inviting 20 of your closest friends. As food, you want to serve them some sandwiches, containing mayonnaise, cucumber and tomato with small pinches of salt and pepper. What steps will you follow? Something along these lines:

```text
1. Take two slices of bread
2. Spread mayonnaise on both slices
3. Cut up the cucumber and tomato
4. Place them on any one slice
5. Sprinkle salt and pepper on the slice
6. Place the other slice on top of this slice
7. Give a nice squeeze to the sandwich so that it is firm
8. Repeat steps 1 through 7 till remaining sandwiches are ready
```

Pay attention to the last step in this list. It asks you to repeat the steps 1 through 7. This is because the steps 1 through 7 only result in one sandwich, but you need 20 sandwiches in total (let's assume that you won't eat any sandwiches). Repeating the steps 20 times will give you the 20 sandwiches.


Now, let's build a similar list for some operation involving computation. Let's say you want to list out all squares from 1 to 100. You can do this as follows:  

```text
1. Initialize num = 1
2. Calculate square = num ** 2
3. Print value of square
4. Change num to num + 1
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 till num = 100
```

This is a very natural set of steps. If you repeat steps 2 through 4, you'll get the squares of all numbers from 1 to 100.

You can visualize the steps as follows:

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/flow_chart_iteration.png"></img>
</p>

This is the essential idea behind iteration: repetition of the same steps many times. Iteration is also referred to as looping, since you're going to the same point as in a loop.

Now, that's all well and good. For you and me, if I tell you to "repeat" something, you'll understand that I want you to do that thing again. But, how do you tell a programming language that you want it to repeat something? In other words, what is the synonym for the word "repeat" in Python? Well, there are two synonyms: `for`-loop and `while`-loop.


When you write some lines of code in a `for`- or `while`-loop, Python will understand that you want it to repeat those lines of code some number of times.

Let's see how you can write each of these loops.

### The `while`-loop

#### Overview

The `while`-loop is a common loop in most programming languages. It repeats some steps till some condition remains `True`. Once the condition becomes `False`, the loop ends and execution continues after the loop.

Let's say that you are having another party. This time, you do not know how many guests are going to be there, but you want to serve sandwiches to all the guests. What do you do? You keep making sandwiches until all the guests have a sandwich. If you look at the list up above, you'll keep repeating steps 1 through 7 till all guests have a sandwich.

A `while`-loop is like this. You do not know the number of iterations of the loop, but you know that it will repeat till some condition becomes false. For the sandwiches, you do not know how many sandwiches you'll end up making, but know that the process will keep going till all guests have a sandwich.

#### The Syntax

To write a `while`-loop in Python, you use the keyword `while`, followed by a `condition` and a `:` (colon):

```python
while condition:
    # body
```

> Note: Trying to run this will produce an error. We will see how we can get rid of that in a future document.

[As for `if`-statements](/5.0%20Control%20Flow%20Statements/5.1%20The%20if%20Statement.md#the-syntax), the indentation becomes important. Anything that you indent one level after the `while` line is part of the loop and will repeat till `condition` becomes `False`.

A natural question arises. What can `condition` be? It can be any expression that evaluates to `True` or `False`, including entities that considered truthy or falsy. For example, `x < 5` is a valid condition for a `while`-loop.

As a rule of thumb, a condition that you can use in an `if`-statement will also  work in a `while`-loop.

To understand it better, let's look at a few examples.

#### Examples

* **Printing squares of numbers between 1 and 100**:

```python
num = 1
while num <= 100:
    print(num ** 2)
    num += 1
```
Here, `num` is first initialized to `1`. Then, we write the `while`-loop with the condition that it should run only till `num <= 100` . For each iteration of the loop, Python is to print the square and increment `num`'s value by 1. When the value of `num` becomes `101`, Python checks the condition in the `while`-loop, evaluating `101 <= 100`. Since this is `False`, the loop stops.

Take note of the final statement in the loop. It increments the value of `num` by 1 in each iteration. This is essential to making the loop stop. Let's assume that there is no increment. Then, for each iteration, the value of `num` will always be `1` and the condition, `num <= 100` will always evaluate to `True` since `1 <= 100`. This would create an _infinite_ loop which never stops running. In most cases, you don't want an infinite loop and should avoid them.

Thus, the condition of the `while`-loop should involve variables that the body of the loop changes. If the variables remain unchanged in each iteration of the loop, it will become infinite.

Sometimes, though, you might want to write an infinite loop as a need. Python provides you with a neat way of doing that.

* **Making a loop run an infinite number of times**:

```python
while True:
    # do something
```

This is simple and intuitive. Since `True` is `True` in each iteration of the loop, the loop becomes infinite. Later, we'll use this method to generate infinitely long series of numbers, so keep it in mind.

In certain cases, you might want to keep taking input from the user till they decide to stop supplying an input. You can achieve this using a `while`-loop.

* **Taking input from user till they decide to stop**:

```python
repeat = True

while repeat:
    num = input("Enter a number: ")
    print("You entered ", num)
    
    prompt = input("Would you like to enter another number? (Y/N) ")
    if prompt in ('N', 'n'):
        repeat = False
```
We first set a variable `repeat` to `True`. Then, the loop will use the variable as its condition. In the first iteration, since the value of `repeat` will be `True`, the loop will execute. In the final statements of the loop, it will ask the user to decide whether they want to input another number or not. The user can enter `Y` or `y` indicating `yes`, and `N` or `n` indicating `no`. If the user enters `N` or `n`, the value of repeat will change to `False`. When this happens, in the next iteration, when the loop checks the condition again, it will evaluate to `False` and the loop won't execute. The loop will stop taking input.

This is a common use case of `while`-loops. In languages such as `C` or `C++`, you would have done this using a `do-while` loop. This loop runs at least once, irrespective of its condition being `True` or `False` in the first iteration. But, Python does not have those and you'll have to use `while`-loops instead.

Once we're done with `for`-loops, we'll look at a few more examples of `while`-loops.

Before we start with `for`-loops though, we need to to discuss another _built-in data type_ in Python

### The `range` data type

#### Overview

I suppose you know what an [arithmetic progression (AP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression) is. On a basic level, an AP is a sequence of numbers where the difference between each pair of successive numbers is constant. In other words, if the sequence is something like this,

a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>,

Then (a<sub>1</sub> - a<sub>0</sub>) = (a<sub>2</sub> - a<sub>1</sub>) = ... = (a<sub>n</sub> - a<sub>n-1</sub>) = constant

This constant is called the _common difference_.

Examples include sequences like `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` and `2, 4, 6, 8, 10`, etc. In the first case, the common difference is `1` and in the second case, the difference is `2`.

`range` is such a sequence of numbers. As far as data types go, it is immutable.

Now, a lot of Python tutorials refer to `range` as a function rather than a data type, but that is not true. `range` _is indeed a data type that you can create using a "function" called `range()`_. This `range()` function is like the `list()` function you can call to create a list, or the `dict()` function you can call to create a dictionary.

Like most other functions, `range()` takes a few arguments. Specifically, it takes three arguments: _start_, _stop_ and _step_. The _start_ argument tells the function where to start the AP. The _stop_ argument tells the function where to end the AP. The _step_ argument tells the function the common difference for the AP.

Thus, you call the function as `range(start, stop, step)`.

There's a catch though. I said that _stop_ tells the function where to end the AP. That's not entirely true. While the _stop_ argument does set an upper bound on the AP, _stop_ is never actually included in the AP. The AP is always inclusive of _start_ and exclusive of _stop_.

As a result, given _start_, _stop_ and _step_, the `range()` function will produce an AP where:

```
First-term = start
Common difference = step
Last-term = stop - step
```

Let's look at a few examples.

#### Examples

* **All even number from 2 to 100**:
 
```python
>>> even = range(2, 101, 2)
>>> even
range(2, 101, 2)
```

Since the sequence should start at `2`, the _start_ argument is `2`. We want even numbers from `2`. If we start counting from `2`, every even number will be 2 more than the previous even number. For example, the next even number, `4` is `2 + 2` and the one after that, `6` is `4 + 2`. Thus, the _step_ argument is `2`.

Though we need even numbers up to 100, the _stop_ argument is `101`. This is because _stop_ is never included in the AP. If _stop_ was `100`, the AP would go till `100 - 2 = 98` and miss `100`. By setting it to `101`, we ensure the result will have `100` in it.

Take note of how entering `even` in the Python prompt does not show you the entire sequence. It confusingly looks like the function you called. This has to do with how `range` is implemented in Python. We'll discuss that later. For now, know that to view the entire sequence, you need to convert `range` to some other sequence like a list or a tuple:

```python
>>> list(even)
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100]
```

* **All odd numbers from 1 to 100**:

```python
>>> odd = range(1, 101, 2)
>>> odd
range(1, 101, 2)
>>> list(odd)
[1, 3, 5, ..., 97, 99]
```
> Note: Ellipses (...) used to shorten output. Actual output is much larger than this.
> 
* **All multiples of 3 from 6 to 100**:

```python
>>> multiples_3 = range(6, 100, 3)
>>> multiples_3
range(3, 100, 3)
>>> list(multiples_3)
[6, 9, 12, ..., 96, 99]
```

It is not always necessary to mention the _step_ argument. In such cases, Python assumes the _step_ to be `1` so that the AP's common difference in `1`.

* **All natural numbers between 1 to 100**:

```python
>>> natural_100 = range(1, 101)
>>> natural_100
range(1, 101)
>>> list(natural_100)
[1, 2, 3, ..., 99, 100]
```

You might think that you're storing 100 numbers through `range`. It must take a lot of memory. But, it doesn't. You can efficiently store thousands of numbers in this without worrying about memory. We'll discuss why that is the case later.

You can even omit the _start_ argument with the _step_. You call the function with one argument, _stop_. In such a case, the AP starts at `0` with a common difference of `1`, ending at `stop - 1`.

* **All whole numbers up to 100**:

```python
>>> whole_100 = range(101)
>>> whole_100
range(0, 100)
>>> list(whole_100)
[0, 1, 2, ..., 99, 100]
```

You can use this to get the indices of a list, tuple or string. In Python, the indexing for a list starts at `0` and ends at one less than its length. For example, for the list, `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the indices are `0, 1, 2, 3`. Thus, by the very nature of `range`, you can use it to get the indices of such sequences.

* **Indices of a list**:

```python
>>> l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> length = len(l)
>>> indices = range(length)
>>> indices
range(0, 10)
>>> list(indices)
[0, 1, ...., 8, 9]
```

Since there are no _start_ and _step_ arguments, they default to `0` and `1` respectively. The length of the list is the _stop_ argument. As a result, the AP will go from 0 to `length - 1`, which are the indices of the items in the list.

**The `range` data type only works with integers. If at least one of its arguments is not an integer, it will give you an error**:

```python
>>> wrong_range = range(10.5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
```

**Since it accepts integers, you can use it with negative numbers**:

```python
>>> negative_range = range(-10, 11)
>>> list(negative_range)
[-10, -9, -8, ..., 9, 10]
```

**You can mention the _step_ to be the negative**. In such a case, the _start_ needs to be greater than the _stop_:

```python
>>> reverse_range = range(10, 0, -1)
>>> list(reverse_range)
[10, 9, ..., 2, 1]
```

### The `for`-loop

#### Overview

The `for`-loop is another common loop in most programming languages.

There's a fundamental difference between `for`- and `while`-loops. In the `while`-loop you do not know the number of times the loop will repeat. It all depends on the condition of the loop. It may repeat once or it may repeat a 1000 times. But, in a `for`-loop you know exactly how many times the loop will repeat.

This is a consequence of the very nature of the `for`-loop. Those of you coming from languages like C/C++, know that you can write a `for`-loop like this:

```c
for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i)
{
    /* code */
}
```

You can read this as:

> Starting from 0 and increasing the value of `i` by 1 each time, run the loop till i is less than count.

There are three distinct parts in this: the starting value of `0`, the increment by `1` and the upper limit of `count`. By providing the loop with these, you're telling it the number of repetitions. If you were to change any one of them, the number of repetitions would change. 

For example, if you were to increment `i` by 2 each time, you would half the number of repetitions. If you were to change the starting value to `1`, there would be one less iteration. If you were to increase `count` by 2, there would be two more iterations.

Whatever be the case, it is _you_ who decides the number of repetitions and not the state of some condition. Sure, you can change the value of `count` inside the loop so that the upper limit changes. But, you'd do that knowing how it will affect the loop.

While this is true in Python as well, you have much less control over the number of repetitions. This is because Python `for`-loops are more like `foreach`-loops. In a `foreach`-loop, the loop always goes over some kind of a sequence and gives the _items_ in the sequence.

You can read it as:

> For each item in the sequence, do something.

As a result, the number of items in the sequence governs the number of repetitions. You may add or delete items from the sequence to alter this number, but the loop will only run as long as the sequence has items in it.

Don't worry. This will become clearer with examples.

#### The Syntax

`for`-loops are better understood when you understand the syntax with the help of examples, so that's what I am going to do.

Say you have the following list:

```python
>>> l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

You can print the values in the list using this `for`-loop:

```python
for item in l:
    print(item)
```

The differences from the standard C loop are clear. First of all, there is no variable like `i` that you need to initialize. Second, you do not need to specify any upper limit for that variable like `count`. Third, you do not need to specify the increment for that variable like `i++`.

Instead, you're actually iterating over each item of the list. By writing the above, you're telling Python this:

> For each item in `l`, pick up the item in the variable called `item` and print its value.

So, there are only two things that you need to mention in your loop:
* The sequence you'll be using (here, `l`)
* The variable you'll be storing the item of the sequence in (here, `item`)

So, the general syntax is as follows:

```python
for var_name in sequence:
    # do something
```

Here, `sequence` is any valid Python sequence such as a list, a tuple or a dictionary. `var_name` can be any valid variable name you can think of. In the above example, I chose to call it `item` but you can call it whatever you like.

For each repetition of the loop, Python will take a value from `sequence`, make `var_name` equal to that value and then run whatever is inside the loop. `var_name` will be available inside the loop and you can manipulate in whatever way you like.

Let's look at a few more examples.

#### Examples

* **Creating a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 100**:

```python
l = []
for num in range(1, 101):
    l.append(num ** 2)
```

`range` is a data type you can use in loops like a list or a tuple. Here, we're creating a `range` starting at `1` and ending at `100`. For each value in `range`, the value is being picked up in `num`. Then, we are appending the square of that value to the list using `.append()`. We will discuss later exactly why you can use `range` in a loop, but for now, keep in mind that you can do so.

* **Accessing the elements of a list using the index**:

In the section about `range`, I showed how you can use it to get the indices of a list:

```python
l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
length = len(l)
indices = range(length)
```

You can use this fact to access elements of a list using the index:

```python
l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
length = len(l)
for i in range(length):
    print("Square of", l[i], "is", l[i] ** 2)
```
Since `range()` has only the _stop_ argument, it will go till `0` to `length - 1`, which are the indices of the items in the list. In each iteration, the loop will take the value in `range` in `i`. It will then access the corresponding element in the list in `print()`. This gives you the following output:

```python
Square of 1 is 1
Square of 2 is 4
Square of 3 is 9
Square of 4 is 16
Square of 5 is 25
Square of 6 is 36
Square of 7 is 49
Square of 8 is 64
Square of 9 is 81
Square of 10 is 100
```

Now, if you can access the items directly by using the list as the sequence in the loop, why use the index? Well, in certain situations, you need the index with you. For example, when implementing some kind of a search, you may need to store the index where you find the element. Python provides you with a neat way of doing this, but we will get to that in a little while.

* **Loop to find _n_ Fibonacci numbers**:

The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence, `1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...`. Here, the first two terms are `1`. After that, each term is the sum of the previous two terms. For example, `2` is `1 + 1` and `3` is `1 + 2`. You can generate this sequence using a `for`-loop:

```python
previous = 0
current = 1
term = 1
n = int(input("Enter n: "))

for i in range(n):
    print(term, end=' ')
    term = previous + current
    previous = current
    current = term
```

When you set `n` as `10`, you will get the first 10 Fibonacci numbers:

```python
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
```

To understand this, let's work through each iteration.

* When `i = 1`:
    - For `print()`, `term = 1` and the value is printed
    - Since `previous`, `current` are `0` and `1`, `term` becomes `1`
    - `previous` becomes `1` since `current` is `1`
    - `current` becomes `1` since `term` is `1`
    - Output so far: `1`

* When `i = 2`:
    - For `print()`, `term = 1` and the value is printed
    - Since `previous`, `current` are `1` and `1`, `term` becomes `2`
    - `previous` becomes `1` since `current` is `1`
    - `current` becomes `2` since `term` is `2`
    - Output so far: `1 1`

* When `i = 3`:
    - For `print()`, `term = 2` and the value is printed
    - Since `previous`, `current` are `1` and `2`, `term` becomes `3`
    - `previous` becomes `2` since `current` is `2`
    - `current` becomes `3` since `term` is `3`
    - Output so far: `1 1 2`

This process goes on till `i = 10`. So, in the i<sup>th</sup> iteration, the loop starts out by printing the i<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number. Then, it calculates the (i+1)<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number, storing that in `term`. Then, it shifts the previous two terms (`previous` and `current`) so that the (i+1)<sup>th</sup> iteration can calculate the (i+2)<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number.


Of course, this is **NOT** the _Pythonic_ way of calculating Fibonacci. Here's how you do it in Python:

```python
a = 1
b = 1
n = int(input("Enter n: "))
for i in range(n):
    print(a, end=' ')
    a, b = b, a + b
```

For n = 10, you get the same output:

```python
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
```

What's happening here? [Tuple unpacking](/3.0%20Data%20types/3.4%20The%20tuple%20data%20type.md#tuple-unpacking-and-packing)! Since we have `a, b = b, a + b`, what Python does behind the scenes is that it creates the tuple, `(b, a + b)` (RHS of `=`). Then, it distributes the two values of the tuple to `a` and `b` respectively (LHS of `=`). So, this line is actually same as:

```python
temp = a + b
a = b
b = temp
```

This is exactly what's happening in our original loop:

```python
term = previous + current
previous = current
current = term
```

* **Dummy variable in loop**:

In certain cases, you might not really use the item you're getting from the sequence in a loop. In that case, naming the variable in your loop something like `item` or `value` makes it look like you're going to use the value somewhere. This makes your code (a little) difficult to understand (a reader might scan the entire loop body to find the usage). 

To avoid this and to make the non-usage of the value more explicit, you can do something like this:

```python
a = 1
b = 1
n = int(input("Enter n: "))
for _ in range(n):
    print(a, end=' ')
    a, b = b, a + b
```

Since the loop was not using the `i` in the Fibonacci example anywhere, I have replaced it with an `_` (underscore). Underscores are valid variable names. Python developers use them as a convention to mean that a value is not useful. You can find Python code that says this:

```python
>>> tup = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
>>> _, *b = tup
```

This means that the first value is not useful and you don't want it. Everything after the first value is useful and hence, taken up in `b`.

### `break` and `continue`

Let's talk about two special keywords that Python provides you with. These keywords are mainly used with loops and they transfer the flow of control.

What do I mean by that? These keywords used stop the execution of a loop midway, or repeat the loop midway.

Let's talk about them one by one.

#### The `break` keyword

The keyword `break`  to stop the execution of a loop midway. When the loop encounters this word, it stops executing and transfers the flow of control to whatever follows the loop. It doesn't matter what you have after `break`. Irrespective of what the loop is doing, `break` will always stop the loop.

Let's look at an example:

```python
l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
key = int(input("Enter element you want to search for: "))
for item in l:
    if key == item:
        print("Item found")
        break
```

> Note: Usage is not limited to `for`-loops. You can use it with `while`-loops as easily.

This is a very simple algorithm called _linear search_, used to search for an item in a sequence. The algorithm goes over each item in the sequence and compares it with the item you're searching for. Once it finds the item in the list, it prints `Item found`. At this point, it doesn't make sense to continue running the loop since you've already found the item. So, using `break`, you can stop the execution midway.

As a result, your loop will go over the list only as long as it doesn't find the item you're looking for. The loop will go over the entire list _only if_ the item is not in the list, since in that case, the `if` condition never evaluates to `True` and `break` is never encountered.

The keyword is useful since it lets the programmer control the loop with more details. Depending on the nature of some condition, you can either stop your loop or you can let it run.

#### The `continue` keyword

You can use this keyword to make your loop go back to the beginning. This statement is easy to misunderstand. You can think that going back to the beginning implies the loop will restart _from_ the beginning. But, that is not the case. 

When a loop encounters a `continue`, the control goes back to the beginning and the loop continues with its next repetition.

Let's look at an example. Say you have the following list:

```python
l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

You want to find all the occurrences of an item in your list. If your item is `4`, you want your program to print `3` and `4` since `4` is present at those indices. You can easily do this using `continue`:


```python
length = len(l)
key = int(input("Enter the element you want to search for: "))
for index in range(length):
    if l[index] == key:
        print("Item found at", index)
        continue
```

When you run this with `key = 4`, you get the following output:

```python
Item found at 3
Item found at 4
```

The standard linear search algorithm stops at the first occurrence of the item. This modified version finds all occurrences of the item. Since you have `continue`, the control will go back to the loop and it will proceed with its next repetition. 

Of course, the `continue` here is redundant since the program works fine without it. A more practical example is when you want your loop to ignore some value based on some condition:

```python
for letter in 'Python':     # First Example
   if letter == 'h':
      continue
   print ('Current Letter:', letter)
```

Here, the `print()` is outside the `if`. When the loop will encounter `letter = h`, the `if` condition will evaluate to `True`. Due to the `continue` inside the `if`, control will go back to the loop and it will repeat, without executing the `print()`. As a result, you will get the following output:

```python
Current Letter: P
Current Letter: y
Current Letter: t
Current Letter: o
Current Letter: n
```

## Conclusion

Well, these are things you need to know to start out with iteration. In at least one more document, we will take a look at best practices and some more conventions when it comes to loops.
