## A Little More on Iteration

So far, you've seen how you can iterate over a set of steps using `for`- and `while`-loops. In this document, we are going to take a look at some best practices when it comes to iteration and Python.

To be more specific, we are going to take a look at a few built-in functions that are commonly used while iterating, and are going to compare `for`- and `while`-loops.

Let's begin by comparing `while`- and `for`-loops.

### `for`- or `while` - Which one?

To be clear, which of the two loops you should use depends completely on the context and your preference. It is always possible to convert any `for`-loop to a `while`-loop and vice-versa, irrespective of complexity.

But, there do exist certain situations where a `for`-loop trumps (ha!) a `while`-loop and vice-versa.
